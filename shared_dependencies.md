Shared Dependencies:

1. **Python Libraries**: All backend files will share common Python libraries such as Flask or Django for web framework, SQLite3 or psycopg2 for database management.

2. **Database Schema**: All backend files and database files will share a common database schema, which includes tables like Players, Teams, Contracts, ScoutingReports, and Negotiations.

3. **API Keys**: The files `api/google_calendar.py` and `api/twilio.py` will share API keys for Google Calendar and Twilio respectively.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The frontend JavaScript files will share DOM element IDs with their corresponding HTML files. For example, `dashboard.js` will share IDs with `dashboard.html` like `#task-list`, `#upcoming-meetings`, `#player-performance`.

5. **CSS Classes**: The frontend CSS files will share class names with their corresponding HTML files. For example, `dashboard.css` will share classes with `dashboard.html` like `.task-card`, `.meeting-card`, `.performance-card`.

6. **Function Names**: Backend files will share function names that correspond to their functionality. For example, `player_management.py` might have functions like `add_player()`, `update_player()`, `delete_player()`. These function names will be shared across files wherever these functionalities are required.

7. **Message Names**: The Twilio API file (`api/twilio.py`) will use message names like `player_added`, `meeting_scheduled`, `contract_updated` for different types of SMS notifications.

8. **Theme Names**: The `themes.js` and `themes.css` files will share theme names like `light-theme`, `dark-theme` for different application themes.

9. **Responsive Design Breakpoints**: The frontend CSS files will share common breakpoints for responsive design, such as `max-width: 600px` for mobile, `max-width: 900px` for tablet, and `min-width: 901px` for desktop.

10. **Performance Metrics**: The `speed_improvements.py` file will share performance metrics with other backend files, such as `query_time`, `response_time`, `load_time` to measure and improve application performance.
